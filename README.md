# Hello there!


<a href="https://zenitsu.me/cal" target="_blank"><img align="right" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/771307030404399115/926473633608630332/ezgif.com-gif-maker_4.gif" alt="Zenitsu" height="130px"></a> 

I'm a computer science student who likes building & designing products. Here is my [behance](https://www.behance.net/calatop) and the [list of projects](https://github.com/Calatop/Calatop/blob/main/projects.md) that I somehow managed to complete. I have [weekly newsletter](https://tanoshi.substack.com/) which you must check.

I like pizza, [biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/51964595), watching [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Calatop), reading [manga](https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/Calatop),  playing [csgo](https://settings.gg/player/279387466) and [gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/calatop) in general. If you like watching people play games jump over to my [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIal5uyyIBPUFq5rLkhLqjg) or join my massive [discord](https://discord.com/invite/shfnNRN) server.
