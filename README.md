# Hello there!

I'm a computer science student who likes building & designing products. Here is my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/calatop) and the [list of projects](https://github.com/Calatop/Calatop/blob/main/projects.md) that I somehow managed to complete. I daily use `.html` `.css` `.js` `.py` `.psd` `.jam`.
I like pizza, biking, watching [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Calatop), reading manga, playing [games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/calatop). If you like watching people play games jump over to my [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIal5uyyIBPUFq5rLkhLqjg) or join my massive [discord](https://discord.com/invite/shfnNRN) server.
