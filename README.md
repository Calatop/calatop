# Hello there! 

I'm a computer science student who likes building & designing products. Here is my [behance](https://www.behance.net/calatop) / [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/calatop) and the [list of projects](https://github.com/Calatop/Calatop/blob/main/projects.md) that I somehow managed to complete. I also run a [weekly newsletter](https://tanoshi.substack.com/) which you should totally check out!
  
I like pizza, [biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/51964595), watching [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Calatop), reading [manga](https://myanimelist.net/mangalist/Calatop),  playing [csgo](https://settings.gg/player/279387466) and [gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/calatop) in general. If you like watching people play games jump over to my [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIal5uyyIBPUFq5rLkhLqjg) or join my massive [discord](https://discord.com/invite/shfnNRN) server.
