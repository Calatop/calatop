I'm a computer science student who likes to [design](https://www.behance.net/rohzzn), draw, and builds things. If you want to collab, you can schedule a [meeting](https://calendly.com/rohzzn/meet). I spent too much of my life playing FPS games and going to tournaments. You can add me as a friend with my discord id `Rohan#0069` or join my [server](https://discord.com/invite/gubvkKGskx). I also sell digital products on [gumroad](https://rohzzn.gumroad.com/), which cost zero dollars. I occasionally code and take part in contests on [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/rohansanjeev) and [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/rohzzn/). 

I joined Github 3 years ago. Since then I pushed 685 commits, opened 5 issues, submitted 7 pull requests, received 31 stars across 28 personal projects, and contributed to 6 public repositories. Support my teeny projects by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/rohzzn) or buy me a cup of [coffee.]()
